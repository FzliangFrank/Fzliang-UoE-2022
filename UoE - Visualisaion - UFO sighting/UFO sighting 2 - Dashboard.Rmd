This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
df_com <- read_csv('./complete.csv')
df_scr <- read_csv('./scrubbed.csv')

df <- df_scr[,c("comments","datetime","latitude","longitude","duration (seconds)")]
df_2 <- df_com[,c("comments","datetime","latitude","longitude","duration (seconds)")]
df$time <- mdy_hm(df$datetime)
df_2$time <- mdy_hm(df_2$datetime)

df_f <- df_2 %>% 
  drop_na("duration (seconds)") %>%
  drop_na("time") %>%
  transform(`duration (seconds)` = as.numeric(`duration (seconds)`)) 
  
```

# Time Density of how this works...
```{r}
with(df_f, plot(x = time, y = duration..seconds., type = "h"))
