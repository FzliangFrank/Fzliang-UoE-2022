# Frank the Tank (Fanzhou Liang)'s Master Thesises at University of Exeter

Welcome!

You have discovered the my very master project I did for my degree at University of Exeter 2020-2021.

Instead of server verything in pretty shiny website I decide to stop being a over a perfectionist I decide to bulk-up-load the wholething. 

Here are some interesting highlights

- Topic Modeling research funding opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (master project) [report.pdf](UoE%20-%20All%20Reports/Fanzhou_Liang_Business_Project_Report.pdf)
- UFO map (with actual UFO icons !!) [visualisation.html](UoE%20-%20Visualisaion%20-%20UFO%20sighting/UFO%20visualisation.html)
- Modeling Covid. [report.doc](UoE%20-%20All%20Reports/Is%20lock%20down%20measure%20effective%20in%20reducing%20covid.docx)
