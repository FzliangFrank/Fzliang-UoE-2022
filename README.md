# Frank the Tank (Fanzhou Liang)'s Master Thesises at University of Exeter

Welcome!

You have discovered the my very master project I did for my degree at University of Exeter 2020-2021.

Instead of server verything in pretty shiny website I decide to stop being a over a perfectionist I decide to bulk-up-load the wholething. 

Here are some interesting highlights

- Topic Modeling research funding opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (master project) [report.pdf](UoE - All Reports/Fanzhou_Liang_Business_Project_Report.pdf)
- UFO map (with actual UFO icons !!) [visualisation.html](UoE - Visualisaion - UFO sighting/UFO visualisation.html)
- Modeling Covid.
