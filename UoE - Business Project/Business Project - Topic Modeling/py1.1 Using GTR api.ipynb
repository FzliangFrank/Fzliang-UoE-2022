Over the first 1-2 years the student will build spectral energy distributions using these data and fit them to theoretical models to study how the population evolves with time and examine their connection to other classes of galaxies selected in deep surveys. He will also compare host properties to afterglow-inferred properties (e.g. inferred metallicity) to study correlations between sightline properties with integrated host properties. Finally, he will employ HST data from a recently-approved Cycle 26 program to constrain the faint-end galaxy luminosity function slope at z=5 and independently test whether faint galaxies were sufficient to reionize the early universe.\n"

      " abstract:  The University of St Andrews has a vibrant postgraduate research community (across the science faculty there are currently over 400 PhD students) and offers DTP funded PhD studentships in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science (in the approximate proportions 35/30/20/15%) including where these disciplines intersect with other sciences including Biology, Medicine and Psychology. For general information on postgraduate study at St Andrews see http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/pg/. As a prospective PhD student, you will apply to work with an individual supervisor or supervisory team within a School \n",
      "http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/university/schools/ or Institute, \n",
      "http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/university/schools/ and not on a specific programme of study. It is therefore important that you look at staff research interests within the University and ensure that your project matches an existing area of research \n",
      "http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/schools/research/. A searchable interface of the research in St Andrews http://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/ provides information about the range of research being undertaken. \n",
      "Areas of priority for DTP funding include photonic materials, biophotonic techniques for diagnosis, therapy and quantum information, catalysis, materials characterization, new physical sciences for biology and health care, synthetic biology, complexity science (in the form of Discrete Mathematics), fluid dynamics, geometry and topology, logic and combinatorics, mathematical analysis, computer systems, programming languages, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence and constraint programming, sensor networks, biomedical modelling cloud and data-driven systems.\n",
      "St Andrews University has a comprehensive transferable skills training programme for all PhD students (GRADskills) \n",
      "http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/capod/students/pgresearch/gradskills/ that is organised by the University's Centre for Academic, Professional and Organisational Development (CAPOD). New PhD students assess their need for generic skills training together with their supervisor and then take the appropriate transferable skills courses (either from the GRADskills programme or externally, e.g. London Mathematical Society and Scottish Mathematical Sciences Training Centre provide specific generic skills training courses). PhD students are required to take at least two generic skills courses each semester. In addition specialist technical courses in the disciplines are provided together with vibrant seminar programs.\n",
      "Applications are accepted via the online system at http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/research/. Schools accept applications throughout the year but begin to make offers of DTP funded places from February onwards.\n"
